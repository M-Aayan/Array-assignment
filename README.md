# Array-assignment
The code manipulates a toDoList array by adding and removing tasks using JavaScript array methods (push, unshift, pop, and shift). These methods allow us to manage the tasks dynamically by adding them at either end of the list and removing them when completed. The program also logs the changes to the console to track the state of the list.
